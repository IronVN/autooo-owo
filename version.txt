Current version: 1.1.2

-Stop if captcha is asked is working perfectly fine now.
-Removed proxy because almost no one use it and it make the code broken for some reason.
-Added error box from tkinter again, Just like 1.0.4 (I removed it for some reason idk).
-Added a bit color (more beautiful).
-For now it will take 7 CPU from your device (actually [number of cpu you have] - 1) to run so... faster code yay (It won't freeze your pc tho)
-For now it will wait 10~15min to use gems (cuz the old one use too fast bruh).
