Current version: 1.1.0

-Fixed stop if captcha is asked a lot (idk if it's still broken)
-Added Credit option, if you choose it then it will show up credit of this repository.
-Added automatically download package if you not download it yet.
-Added automatically create newdata for you if you not enter the information yet (so you don't need to turn off and choose option 2 anymore... yay?)
-Removed issuechecker2 and check if there any captcha in DMs because those are useless.
-It will return an understandable error description for now if you choose wrong option number (1,2,3) in the menu.
-It will automatically save and close after you create newdata for now (nvm ignore this).
-TypeError: String indices must be intenger error is no longer exist (Yea fixed).
-Int error andJson decode error still here for some reason, Jsondecode error is maybe because your PC (I figured out how to solve Int error but later).

Note: The code will use gateway (response) to run now so it's better than the old one. Maybe...
